    <h1>Alex's Introduction</h1>
    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <h3> Why I'm taking this class</h3>
    <p>I am taking this class as I am looking into if I want to pursue a career in graphic design. 
        This class is part of the graphic design path here at mcc. 
        I have never done anything more than the hour of code we did in school and am very excited to see more past that.
    </p>
    <h2>Alex's Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Crochet</h3>

        <p> I absolutely love to crochet. I first tried to learn in middle school but couldn't get the hang of it. 
            Once we came back from covid I decided to try again and have become some what of a pro.
            I used to fail at making more than a few rows and now I'm finishing up a dress for myself.
            I carry around skeins of yarn in my bag and always have crochet hooks on me. 
        </p>
    <h3>Drawing</h3>

        <p> Along with crocheting, I love to draw. I am a very artsy and creative person. 
            I have been drawing since I was a kid. I used to copy my older sisters style until she got her own room.
            That's really wehn I started honing in my own style and is now why I pursue graphic desing.
