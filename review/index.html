    <p>
      The Holdovers is an emotional and movie story which follows Angus Tully,
      portraid by Dominic Sessa, a student who has to stay at school over winter
      break with his teacher Paul Hunham, portraid by Paul Giamatti, and Mary
      Lamb, portraid by Da'Vine Joy Randolph. During this winter break each
      character learns to deal with their frustration of being forced to stay,
      thus forcing them to be alone for christmas. The movie does an amazing job
      of not only pulling you into the story, but feeling everything with them
      as well. You watch as each character opens up about their own griefs,
      regrets, and problems, as they slowly go from hating each other to
      learning to be compasionate. Helping to prove that no matter who you are,
      company and community is always a part of healing, emotions may be
      childish, and joy exists where you create it.

    <p>
      The main problem the characters are encountered with is Tully and Hunham's
      seeming hatred for each other. Hunham is a strict teacher who punishes
      much faster than he rewards, and Tully is a student who would faster throw
      an insult than an apology.
      <strong>
        both blame each other for their predicament and start of hating each
        other.</strong
      >
      In their time together they both learn of the grief they deal with
      individually. This helps them as part of this grief is Tully feeling as if
      he has been abandoned by his mother, and Hunahm regreting that he chose
      work over life. The real kicker is learning about Lamb's own childloss and
      seeing Tully and Hunham realize how selfish they have been. As well as
      simultaniously teaching each other how to be stricter, how to relax, and
      how to love.

      In a sense, the entirety of the Holdovers is a giant lesson on life. One
      of my favorite quotes is Hunman speaking to Tully about his roudyness. he
      states
      <ins>
        "There's nothing new in human experience, Mr. Tully. Each generation
        thinks it invented debauchery or suffering or rebellion, but man's every
        impulse and appetite from the disgusting to the sublime is on display
        right here all around you."</ins
