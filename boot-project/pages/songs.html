                There is a calmness to this song that just soothes. It creates a
                sense of safety while complaining about how capitalism and
                consumerism has consumed us. Every verse is set up like a
                different commercial or infomercial and I love it. The way this
                song is written is what makes me love it and not just what it's
                about.

                This song is a true favorite. When I first listened, the queer
                message really caught me off guard because it was natural
                representation that I feel doesn't happen enough. It isn't a big
                part of queer culture, just apart of love song culture in a
                sense. It makes me feel seen in my identity as a normal thing,
                which feels very rare these days.

            This song contains my favorite line in any written piece of music in
            exists- "He said everything will be alright, not every sunday can be
            Easter". It is a masterpiece of a line and just ignites my soul.

            This song is on this list purely for the play on words. It's another
            love song but is just so genius. Of course it's about missing the
            person you love, but it goes deeper than that. It uses "missing"
            literally. Saying that with you physically missing from my life,
            like a lost item, I myself am lost; but in a sweet joking way that
            is just amazing.

            <dd>Last Night on Earth is THE modern love ballad. It starts of the song by bringing in the sweetness and sincerity of love letters but through text and makes it beautiful instead of corny. It such a true and vulnerable decleration of my love is yours. It is a 50/50 on if this song will make my day or make me cry.</dd>
