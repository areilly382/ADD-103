              I have been doing theatre since the summer going into sixth grade.
              I only found out about the audition because I overheard my teacher
              telling another student about it. I went in and even said "oh I
              have stage fright no thanks," when I was asked if I wanted to try
              again since I had to go first. This started a life long passion
              now. I took all the theatre classes I could in highschool and
              strived to do my best. I started going to Illinois State for
              theatre studies but ended up never actually getting a chance to
              perform. I wasn't allowed to take any performance classes because
              they all filled, even though I was supposed to be a performance
              major. It was all very weird.

              I just closed my first show since graduating highschool,
              Metamorphoses written by Marry Zimmerman and directed by Jay
              Geller, here at mcc. It was like a major weight was liften off of
              my chest once I got cast. That show has been my favorite
              performance. Not because it's my most recent, but because that is
              where you see the most growth from me. Even in two years of not
              performing and taking a singular acting class, I have made
              incredible strides. Not to even mention the pool that was our set
              which was just so incredibly cool.
