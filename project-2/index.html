        I have been doing theatre since the summer going into sixth grade. I only found out about the audition because I overheard my teacher telling another student about it. I went in and even said "oh I have stage fright no thanks," when I was asked if I wanted to try again since I had to go first. This started a life long passion now. I took all the theatre classes I could in highschool and strived to do my best. I started going to Illinois State for theatre studies but ended up never actually getting a chance to perform. I wasn't allowed to take any performance classes because they all filled, even though I was supposed to be a performance major. It was all very weird. I just closed my first show since graduating highschool, Metamorphoses written by Marry Zimmerman and directed by Jay Geller, here at mcc. It was like a major weight was liften off of my chest once I got cast. That show has been my favorite performance. Not because it's my most recent, but because that is where you see the most growth from me. Even in two years of not performing and taking a singular acting class, I have made incredible strides. Not to even mention the pool that was our set which was just so incredibly cool.
