      <h2>Yarn is expensive</h2>
      <p>Let’s talk crochet! I have been crocheting for about 4 years now and there are three things that have really surprised me. The first: blankets are surprisingly hard and take a very long time to make, I have one I’ve been working on for about 2 years now; second: yarn is so expensive for just some thread but that’s an ethics argument; and third: it is so much easier than expected and so addicting. I am constantly crocheting. There’s a 99% chance that there is yarn on me at all times. I’ve been miles away from home with no crochet project in site and still found yarn. It’s crazy. The blanket I’ve been working on is my first ever project. At this point it’s my emotional support project. It’s made of 91 granny squares and will hopefully span 6 feet by 6 feet. It takes about 2 hours to sow a row of 9 together. My most recent favorite projects have been this balloon dog, ghost drawstring bag, and this little dinosaur with trousers. It’s been so fun learning how to create different things and the little details that make a world of a difference.</p>
