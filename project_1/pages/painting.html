        <p>
          I am constantly creating. Either drawing or writing or anything. I
          love to leave a bit of my creations with my friends. My biggest
          example is this little mushroom design seen in the image. About two or
          three years ago, I drew it on a friend using henna and he said that he
          would get it tattooed. Everyone thought it was a joke but here it is
          in fruition. We don’t talk anymore but the fact that he still did it
          meant a lot. It’s a crazy thought to have your art permanently on
          someone. Although I make visual art way less often than I used to,
          it’s still one of my favorite things. It’s my go to when I’m bored,
          overwhelmed, or just need an escape. I think a lot faster than I can
          produce though, so I constantly have unfinished work in projects.
          Right now, I have three canvasses of half-finished paintings. Not to
          even mention the amount of unfinish work in my sketchbooks. I also
          love to mess around with makeup and consider it painting cause that's
          how I view it. Makeup is just painting on my face.
