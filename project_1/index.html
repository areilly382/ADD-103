        Hey! My name is Alex Reilly. I am a part-time student at Mchenry County College pursuing graphic design. I am from Huntley, IL, and have lived there since I was 3. I am a very creative person. Right now I am performing in Metamorphoses by Marry Zimmerman and directed by Jay Geller here at MCC. This will be my first show in two years. Which is crazy because for four years I was doing at least 3 a school year. Almost everything I do has to do with creating. I am constantly writing or crocheting or something. I originally was going to Illinois State for theatre but needed to find a different path so graphic design just seemed like the natural next step. Metamorphoses opens on November 1st at 7pm and has performances on NOvember 2nd, 3rd, 8th, 9th, 10th, 15th, 16th, and 17th. The show starts at 7pm on Fridays and Saturdays and 2pm on Sundays. Oh and I canâ€™t talk about me without mentioning my best friend Kat. Her name is Arianna but I have always called her Kat. She is my ride or die. Right now we are working on creating a podcast and mini production company type thing as we both love theatre and dream of creating with eachother.
