      <p>
        Hey! My name is Alex Reilly. I am a part-time student at Mchenry County
        College pursuing graphic design. I am from Huntley, IL, and have lived
        there since I was 3. I am a very creative person. Right now I am
        performing in Metamorphoses by Marry Zimmerman and directed by Jay
        Geller here at MCC. This will be my first show in two years. Which is
        crazy because for four years I was doing at least 3 a school year.
        Almost everything I do has to do with creating. I am constantly writing
        or crocheting or something.
